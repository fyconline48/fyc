Need for Speed, one of the world's bestselling video game
franchises returns with a vengeance in the new Need for Speed
Payback.
Set in the underworld of Fortune Valley, you and your crew were
divided by betrayal and reunited by revenge to take down The
House, a nefarious cartel that rules the city's casinos,
criminals and cops. In this corrupt gambler's paradise, the
stakes are high and The House always wins.
Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual
customisation than ever before. Push them to the limit when you
narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. From insane heist
missions to devastating car battles to jaw-dropping set piece
moments, Need for Speed Payback delivers an edge-of-your-seat,
adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.
Key Features:
Scrap to stock to supercar. Your car is at the center of
everything you do in Need for Speed Payback. Endlessly fine-tune
your performance with each of the five distinct car classes
(Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag and Runner) to turn the tables on
the competition in any race, mission or challenge.
Live out an action-driving fantasy. Play as three distinct
characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and
Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the
ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with
ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city
and drive on and off-road through mountains, canyons and
deserts.
High stakes competition. Win big with all-new Risk vs Reward
gameplay. Intense cop chases mean the stakes have never been
higher. Challenge your friends or potential rivals via Autolog
recommendations throughout the events or go head-to-head in
classic online leaderboards.

Instructions:

- Burn or mount the image
- Install the game
- Copy the crack
- Enjoy
