Complete suite to create HTML5 and hybrid mobile applications.
Languages
The DecSoft App Builder apps are based in HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are the languages that you must know (more or less) in order to create modern apps that run in all the mobile and desktop browsers, as well platforms like Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows. All with the same base code! This is a big reason to choose DecSoft App Builder.
Visual designer
App Builder provide us dozens of visual and non visual controls ready to be placed in the application's designer. Simply drag and drop the control that you need into the designer and then place it where you wanted.
Contextual help
DecSoft App Builder has a contextual help that point you exactly to the control, property, event reference, etc. Just press the F1 key where you are in the IDE. For your convenience, the help is also available online in: getappbuilderhelp.com
Apache Cordova
DecSoft App Builder is integrated with Apache Cordova and prepares for your app the right config file, platform icons, splash screens, batch files, shell files and JSON files. DecSoft App Builder integrates also the officials Apache Cordova plugins.
Quick code list
The DecSoft App Builder code editors provides the Quick code list for your convenience. The Quick code list helps you to write Javascript code more faster, providing all the available controls properties, methods and more.
App Files manager
The DecSoft App Builder IDE incorporates the right Files manager for your app, so you can link Javascript and stylesheet files, but also add images, other files (like JSON files) and even entire directories, to be available in your app at runtime.
User Functions
In addition to the available app methods and the methods provided by the app views, app dialogs, app frames, the Apache Cordova plugins methods, and, all the possible controls that you can use, its also possible to setup your own User Functions in order to be available for your app at runtime.
Auto scale apps
There are many themes availables for your app, and, you can also set the fixed and scaled styles, even at runtime. The auto scale style made the app properly show in different screen sizes.
Whats New
* Some minor changes has been made in some DecSoft App Builder controls in order to avoid some warnings while debugging our apps using the new "builder.debug.min.js" file. The same minor changes has been made also in some of the DecSoft app plugins included out of the box with the product.
* This release of the product incorporates a "builder.debug.min.js" file which is used while we are debugging our apps (F9). This file contains the non production versions of the VueJS, VueJS Router and Pinia libraries, which offers to us valuable information (in the internal developer console or any other browser developer console) while debugging our apps. This file is automatically used now by our apps when we are debugging it. On the other hand, the "builder.min.js" file, which contains the production versions of the referred libraries, is the one used when we build our apps (CTRL + F9) in order to be published, for example. This improvement in the product can be very useful while debugging our apps, since the non production versions of the referred libraries offers to us valuable information while debugging our apps.
