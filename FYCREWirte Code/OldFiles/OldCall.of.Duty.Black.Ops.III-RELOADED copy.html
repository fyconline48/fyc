Call of Duty Black Ops III (c) Activision
   
11/2015 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action, Adventure
 

 Treyarch, developer of the two most-played games in Call of Duty history,
 returns with Call of Duty: Black Ops III. For the first time with
 three-years of development, the revered, award-winning studio has created
 its first title for next-gen hardware in the critically acclaimed Black Ops
 series. Welcome to Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, a dark, twisted future where
 a new breed of Black Ops soldier emerges and the lines are blurred between
 our own humanity and the technology we created to stay ahead, in a world
 where cutting-edge military robotics define warfare.


 Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 combines three unique game modes: Campaign,
 Multiplayer and Zombies, providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious
 Call of Duty ever. The Campaign has been designed as a co-op game that can
 be played with up to 4 players online or as a solo cinematic thrill-ride.
 Multiplayer will be the franchise's deepest, most rewarding and most
 engaging to date, with new ways to rank up, customize, and gear up for
 battle. And Zombies delivers an all-new mind-blowing experience with its
 own dedicated narrative. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 can be played entirely
 online, and for the first time each of the offerings has its own unique
 player XP and progression systems. The title ushers in an unprecedented
 level of innovation, including jaw-dropping environments, never before
 experienced weaponry and abilities, and the introduction of a new, improved
 fluid movement system. All of this is brought to life by advanced
 technology custom crafted for this title, including new AI and animation
 systems, and graphics that redefine the standards Call of Duty fans have
 come to expect from the critically-acclaimed series, with cutting edge
 lighting systems and visual effects.


 INTRODUCING A NEW ERA OF BLACK OPS:Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 deploys its
 players into a future where bio-technology has enabled a new breed of Black
 Ops soldier. Players are now always on and always connected to the
 intelligence grid and their fellow operatives during battle. In a world
 more divided than ever, this elite squad consists of men and women who have
 enhanced their combat capabilities to fight faster, stronger, and smarter.
 Every soldier has to make difficult decisions and visit dark places in this
 engaging, gritty narrative.


 A CALL OF DUTY CAMPAIGN UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE IT:Treyarch elevates the
 Call of Duty social gaming experience by delivering a campaign with the
 ability to play cooperatively with up to four players online, using the
 same battle-tested network infrastructure and social systems that support
 its world-class Multiplayer and Zombies game modes. Designed for co-op and
 re-playability, players encounter all the epic cinematic gameplay moments
 Call of Duty is known for delivering as well as new open-area arena-style
 gameplay elements designed to allow players to approach the game with a
 different strategy each time they play. And now, every player is completely
 customizable: from weapons and loadouts, to abilities and outfits, all with
 full progression systems and a personalized armory to show off
 accomplishments, providing a constantly-evolving campaign experience.


 PREPARE FOR A LEVELED-UP MULTIPLAYER:With Black Ops 3, Treyarch premieres a
 new momentum-based chained-movement system, allowing players to fluidly
 move through the environment with finesse, using controlled thrust jumps,
 slides, and mantling abilities in a multitude of combinations, all while
 maintaining complete control over your weapon at all times. Maps are
 designed from the ground-up for the new movement system, allowing players
 to be successful with traditional movement, as well as advanced tactics and
 maneuvers.


 Black Ops 3 multiplayer also introduces the new Specialist character
 system, which allows players to rank up and master each specific
 character's battle-hardened capabilities and weapons. With this addition to
 Traditional and Weapons XP progressions systems, Black Ops 3 multiplayer
 gives players three different ways to rank up.


 FIGHT THE UNDEAD IN AN ALL-NEW HORROR STORY:No Treyarch title would be
 complete without its signature Zombies offering  a full-game experience
 with its own distinct storyline right out of the box. Black Ops 3 Zombies
 is the most immersive and ambitious Call of Duty Zombies to date, with a
 full XP-based progression system for players that adds depth and
 re-playability to the engaging gameplay Zombies fans have come to expect.


 Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 delivers the ultimate 3-games-in-1 experience.
